# DeivaBot – Simple Python Chatbot 🤖

A rule-based chatbot built using Python and basic NLP concepts. This project was created by **Deva Lakshmi** as a part of her internship portfolio to demonstrate interest in machine learning and natural language processing.

## 💡 Features
- Understands basic greetings and questions
- Uses cosine similarity to find the closest response
- CLI-based interaction with the bot

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- JSON

## 📁 Files
-  `chatbot.py`: Main Python file to run the chatbot
-  `intents.json`: Contains intents, patterns, and responses
-  `README.md`: Project overview

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk scikit-learn

Run the chatbot:
python chatbot.py

💬 Sample Interaction

You: hi
🤖 DeivaBot: Hello! How can I help you today?

You: what's up?
🤖 DeivaBot: Not much, just here to chat with you!

You: quit
🤖 DeivaBot: Bye, take care!

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- Integrate a transformer model like BERT for better understanding
- Train the bot on real-world conversations

## 📚 What I Learned
- Basics of natural language processing using NLTK
- Using cosine similarity for intent matching
- Building a rule-based chatbot in Python
